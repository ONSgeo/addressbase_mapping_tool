## Mapping tool using AddressBase data and Open Geography Portal maps
A tool which takes a table of locations and classifications from AddressBase and plots those locations against whatever boundaries you can think of.
Works well with [Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/) maps.

### Instructions: 
Open mapping_tool.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. It has been set up with some sample data so you can work through that to see how it works, or if you prefer you can read the guide in the docs directory.

This was made by [Samantha Iacob](mailto:samantha.iacob@ons.gov.uk) as part of her apprenticeship rotation through the ONS Geospatial team in DALI.
